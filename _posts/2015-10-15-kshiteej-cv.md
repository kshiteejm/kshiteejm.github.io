## Relevant Projects

**ATHENA** - IBM Research, 2014-15  
A multicast scheme for one-to-many group communication traffic patterns
in SDN based data centers. Modified PGM protocol to centralize
reliability and implemented a heuristic that governs the sender’s
transmission rate in a TCP-friendly manner. Evaluation with modified
OpenStack using our scheme in a small data center reported more than
2.5x gains in VM provisioning time

**JURY** - IBM Research, 2014-15  
Developed a system to validate all controller actions via an honest
majority in real time without imposing restrictions on the controller
activities assuming a threat model with a minority of malicious
controllers

**HANSEL** - IBM Research, 2015  
Developed a system that leverages non-intrusive network monitoring to
expedite root cause analysis of faults manifesting in OpenStack
operations using a self-defined construct of execution graph

**SPHINX** - IBM Research, 2013-14  
Explored security attacks and associated impact in SDN. Developed a
controller-agnostic system for real time detection of known and unknown
security attacks originating from compromised hosts and soft-switches.
Used the construct of incremental flow-graphs and the flow-consistency
validator algorithm

**Coexistence of Heterogeneous Networks over Whitespaces** - IIT Delhi,
2012-13  
Aimed to solve interference issues in unlicensed whitespaces.Developed a
minimal, overlay MAC layer, which is spectrum-aware, coexistence aware &
QoS aware, as a wrapper for existing layer-2 wireless protocols

**TCP in Wireless Environments** - IIT Delhi, 2012  
Analyzed performance of TCP (Reno, Cubic, Veno & Westwood+) in wireless
networks. Implemented a modified version of TCP Westwood+ by adjusting
the weightage of long-term averaged and sampled available bandwidth to
cater to dynamic changes in wireless network conditions

**Wireless Jammer** - IIT Delhi, 2011  
Developed two attacks that degraded the performance of WLANs. A physical
layer attack using USRP2 Board & GNU Radio Software Platform. A MAC
layer based de-authentication attack which exploited the loopholes in
the management frames of Wi-Fi b/g protoco using patched Intel Wi-Fi
drivers

**Protocol for Inter-Cell communication** - IIT Delhi, 2010  
Based on a molecule based inter-cell communication simulator designed by
our Professor. Designed and analyzed robust communication protocols for
inter cell molecular communication among antibody cells in a lossy
unreliable medium. Also designed combat strategies against infection
cells

## Other Experiences

**Team Leader,** Team Garuda. CanSat Competition, Texas, US - Jan 2012
to Jan 2013  
Developed the On-Flight Control Software, the Ground Station Data
Acquisition Software & the wireless telemetry for the Atmospheric
Reentry Vehicle built by us. Secured 3rd place
